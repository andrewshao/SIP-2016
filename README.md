Code samples from internship at UCSC 2016. Worked with orphan globular clusters in the Virgo Cluster of Galaxies to determine their parent galaxy and origins. Found that their parent galaxy was M87 using radial velocity and apparent magnitude distributions. Used spectra (specifically Hbeta and Magnesium triplet absorption lines) and modelled against stellar population synthesis models.
